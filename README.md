# The Movie DB Coding Challenge

This project is a movie database application that includes both a frontend and a backend service. The frontend is built with React using Vite, and the backend is built with NestJS and TypeORM. The application is deployed on Vercel at [cristiantovar.com](https://inlaze.cristiantovar.com/). **Beware** that it takes while to load the initial data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:
- `./frontend` - Contains the React frontend.
- `./backend` - Contains the NestJS backend.

## Frontend Setup

1. Clone the project:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:arepaFlipper/inlaze_films.git
cd ./inlaze_films
```
1. **Create the `.env` files**
Add your credentials in these files:
```bash
cp ./frontend/.env.example ./frontend/.env
cp ./backend/.env.example ./backend/.env
```
2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Vite development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the frontend application and make it available at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Build the Project**

   Build the frontend application for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Preview the Production Build**

   Preview the production build locally:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

5. **Linting**

   Run ESLint to check for code quality issues:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

## Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Docker**

   The backend uses PostgreSQL, which is configured through `docker-compose`. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Start the PostgreSQL service:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the NestJS server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

There is no production backend yet. ðŸ˜”

4. I wrote some python scripts to make requests to the endpoints as Postman does:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install requests

python3 ./backend/test/register.spec.py

python3 ./backend/test/verify_email.spec.py
```


7. **Testing**

   Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   Watch for changes and re-run tests:

  ```bash
   npm run test:watch
  ```
